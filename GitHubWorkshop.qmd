## Accepting Contributors Work

-   The owner of the repo can accept your pull-request and add your changes to the main repository

-   This is just one way to use version control and collaborate on GitHub!

## More Collaboration

-   A repo can have many contributors with many different levels of access. Example: <https://github.com/tidyverse/datascience-box>

-   Projects can be used to create boards (like Trello) to facilitate effective collaboration

## Revert a change

-   Reverting a change is one of the most important features of version control.

-   Right now, it *not* possible on GitHub's website

-   I will show you how to revert a change on the GitHub desktop app
