# Why Git/Github?

## What do I name my file?

-   Have your students ever named files in strange ways?
-   3 years ago I oversaw my 3 students doing research with Covid-19 data....
-   Their files names included...

## What wrong with this?

-   In the chat, guess the problems this approach led to...

## Funny, but what now?

I was slightly amused at the time, but it lead to bad outcomes

-   Team members didn't know what script file had what in it
-   They confused versions of data, scripts, and papers
-   They built models on old variants of data
-   In the end, their work was not trustworthy

## (Some) Important Components of Good Analaysis'

-   Reproducibility

-   Collaboration

# Git and GitHub

## What is Git? {.smaller}

"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency." (git, <https://git-scm.com/>)

-   a software

-   version control

-   operates in a terminal

## What is GitHub?

"GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses Git software" (Wikipedia, 2024, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub>)

## A service that hosts your repository (files/folders) online

## Opiniated reasons to use Git/GitHub

-   Free
-   coding (I use R)
-   forced collaboration
-   students make more deliberate choices
-   integration in RStudio
-   GitHub Pages
-   Student Job preparedness

## What to expect in the GitHub Workshop?

-   Git and GitHub terminology
-   Hands on practice collaboration: Fork a repo and complete a pull request
-   Help me fix my typos
-   Additional options for educators
